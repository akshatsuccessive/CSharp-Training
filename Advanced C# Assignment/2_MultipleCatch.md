# When should we write multiple catch blocks for a Single Try block? 

There are multiple catch blocks for a single Try block, each catch block is used for handling different types of exception and the code within that catch block is executed only if the corresponding execution occurs in Try block. When we write a piece of code in the try block there is a possibility that more than one exception may occur so keeping this in mind we write more than one catch block.
